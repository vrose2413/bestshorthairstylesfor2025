In the sprawling, monster-infested realms of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, where every shadow might conceal a ghoul and every decision carries weighty consequences, one might assume that the mundane act of personal grooming would be the least of Geralt of Rivia’s concerns. Yet, amidst the grim realities of the Path, the developers at CD Projekt Red masterfully wove in a surprising layer of personalization: the ability to change Geralt’s hairstyle and trim his ever-growing beard. This seemingly minor detail adds a profound touch of immersion, allowing players to truly shape their version of the White Wolf, transforming him from the iconic, battle-hardened figure into a reflection of their own aesthetic preferences.

More than just a cosmetic tweak, the barber shops in The Witcher 3 serve as small oases of normalcy in a world perpetually teetering on the brink of chaos. They offer a brief respite from the visceral combat, the political intrigue, and the constant threat of supernatural horrors. Stepping into a barber’s establishment is an opportunity to pause, to reflect, and to consider Geralt not just as a monster slayer, but as a character capable of expressing a modicum of personal style, even if that style is merely a choice between a loose ponytail and a neat undercut.

The inclusion of these establishments speaks volumes about CD Projekt Red’s meticulous attention to detail and their commitment to player agency. While Geralt’s default appearance – his long, flowing white hair and often unkempt beard – is instantly recognizable and deeply ingrained in the lore, the option to deviate from it empowers players. It allows for a deeper connection to the character, transforming him from a pre-defined protagonist into a more malleable avatar for the player’s journey. Do you envision your Geralt as a rugged, untamed warrior, or a more refined, almost scholarly figure? His hair and beard can now reflect that vision.

But where exactly does one find these purveyors of follicular artistry in the vast Northern Kingdoms and beyond? While the game doesn’t pepper every hamlet with a barber, there are several key locations where Geralt can indulge in a bit of self-care, each reflecting the unique atmosphere of its respective region.

### The Bustling Metropolis: Novigrad

Perhaps the most obvious and easily accessible location for a haircut is the sprawling, multi-tiered city of Novigrad. As the largest and most vibrant urban center in the Northern Kingdoms, Novigrad is a melting pot of cultures, professions, and social strata. From the opulent homes of wealthy merchants to the squalid hovels of the poor, the city pulsates with life, and with it, the various services one would expect in a thriving metropolis.

Within Novigrad’s labyrinthine streets, Geralt can find a barber shop situated conveniently close to the heart of the city’s activity: **near Hierarch Square**. Specifically, if you fast travel to the Hierarch Square signpost, head south-east, and you’ll quickly spot the barber’s distinctive sign – often a pair of scissors or a comb – hanging outside a building.

The Novigrad barber shop, much like the city itself, feels bustling and professional. It’s a place where Geralt can blend in, if only for a moment, among the throngs of citizens concerned with their own daily routines. The atmosphere inside is typically modest but functional, with the tools of the trade neatly arranged and the barber himself often engaging in casual banter or offering advice on the latest styles. For many players, this Novigrad establishment will be their first foray into customizing Geralt’s look, a memorable initiation into the game’s subtle yet impactful personalization features. It’s a perfect spot for Geralt to shed the dust of the road and present a more polished appearance before delving into the city’s complex political landscape or its seedy underworld.

### The Academic Hub: Oxenfurt

A short boat ride or a pleasant stroll across the Pontar River from Novigrad lies the scholarly city of Oxenfurt. Known for its prestigious academy and its more subdued, intellectual atmosphere compared to Novigrad’s boisterous chaos, Oxenfurt offers a different kind of urban experience. It’s a city of students, professors, and thinkers, where debates over philosophy are as common as brawls in the taverns.

Fittingly, Oxenfurt also hosts a barber, providing Geralt with another opportunity to refine his appearance. The Oxenfurt barber shop is located **in the main market area of the city, not far from the city’s main gate and the Pontar bridge leading to Novigrad**. If you enter Oxenfurt from the Novigrad side, proceed straight into the market square, and you should spot the barber’s sign among the various stalls and shops.

The Oxenfurt barber shop might feel a little less grand than its Novigrad counterpart, perhaps reflecting the city’s more grounded, less ostentatious nature. It’s a place where students might get a quick trim before an important lecture, or where professors might maintain a respectable appearance. For Geralt, it offers a moment of quiet contemplation, a chance to shed the signs of his arduous journey before perhaps engaging with the city’s more learned inhabitants or investigating its own unique brand of mysteries. The convenience of its location near the main entry point into the city makes it an easy stop for players passing through.

### The Sun-Drenched Paradise: Beauclair (Blood and Wine DLC)

For players who venture into the vibrant, sun-drenched duchy of Toussaint through the *Blood and Wine* expansion, a new level of sophistication and opulence awaits. Toussaint is a land of chivalry, fine wines, and breathtaking beauty, a stark contrast to the war-torn lands of the North. Naturally, such a refined society demands a higher standard of personal presentation, and Geralt is no exception.

The capital city of Toussaint, **Beauclair**, boasts perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing and fitting location for a barber. In a city where appearances and social graces are paramount, the coiffeur in Beauclair is not just a necessity but an institution. You can find the barber shop located **in the main market square of Beauclair, close to the central fountain and the entrance to the Palace of the Duchess**. It’s an easily identifiable spot in the heart of the city’s bustling commercial district.

The Beauclair barber shop feels distinctly more upscale than those in the Northern Kingdoms. The ambiance is brighter, perhaps more elegant, reflecting the duchy’s overall prosperity and its inhabitants’ appreciation for the finer things in life. Here, Geralt can truly transform himself, perhaps even adopting a style that better suits the courtly intrigue and grand tournaments of Toussaint. The very act of getting a haircut in Beauclair feels like an indulgence, a moment of luxury in Geralt’s otherwise rugged existence. It underscores the cultural shift from the grim realities of Velen and Novigrad to the almost idyllic, albeit still dangerous, landscape of Toussaint.

### The Mechanics of a Makeover

Regardless of the location, the process of getting a haircut in The Witcher 3 is straightforward and consistent. Upon interacting with a barber, Geralt is presented with a menu of available hairstyles and beard options. The cost for a trim or a complete style change is a paltry sum of **10 Crowns**, a negligible amount even in the early stages of the game, making this cosmetic feature highly accessible to all players.

The available hairstyles generally include:

* **Loose, Tied Back:** Geralt’s iconic look, often with a slight variation.
* **Loose, Not Tied Back:** A wilder, more untamed appearance.
* **Short, Shaved Sides, Ponytail:** A more modern, edgy look.
* **Elven Rebel Cut:** A distinct, asymmetrical style.
* **Short, Styled:** A neat, cropped look.
* **Shaved Sides, Long on Top:** Another contemporary option.

For beards, the options are equally diverse:

* **Clean Shaven:** A surprisingly youthful look for Geralt.
* **Short Stubble:** A classic, rugged appearance.
* **Full Beard:** The default, often unkempt look that grows over time.
* **Braided Beard:** A unique, more stylized option.

It’s worth noting the dynamic beard growth mechanic in The Witcher 3. If Geralt chooses to keep a beard, it will gradually grow longer over time as the player progresses through the game. Visiting a barber allows him to trim it back to a shorter length or shave it entirely. This subtle detail further enhances the game’s realism and immersion, making Geralt’s appearance feel truly dynamic.

### More Than Just Aesthetics: The Role-Playing Implication

The ability to customize Geralt’s appearance through haircuts is far more than a simple aesthetic choice; it’s a significant role-playing element. It allows players to imbue Geralt with a subtle layer of personality that might otherwise be absent. Do you see Geralt as a pragmatic professional who maintains a clean, no-nonsense look? Or perhaps a more bohemian wanderer who lets his hair grow wild? The choices available, though limited, are distinct enough to convey these different interpretations.

Furthermore, changing Geralt’s look can subtly influence the player’s perception of him throughout the narrative. A clean-shaven Geralt might feel more vulnerable or less imposing, while a meticulously styled Geralt might seem more refined or even arrogant. These minor visual cues can deepen the player’s connection to the character and the unfolding story, allowing for a more personalized narrative experience.

In a game celebrated for its rich narrative, complex characters, and expansive world, the inclusion of something as seemingly trivial as a barber shop highlights CD Projekt Red’s commitment to creating a truly immersive experience. It’s a testament to their understanding that even the smallest details can contribute significantly to the overall sense of realism and player agency. The ability to guide Geralt through monster hunts, political conspiracies, and deeply personal quests, all while maintaining a meticulously chosen hairstyle, underscores the profound depth of *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*.

So, the next time you find Geralt looking a bit too dishevelled after a particularly brutal monster contract, remember that a brief detour to Novigrad, Oxenfurt, or the elegant streets of Beauclair can offer more than just a fresh look. It offers a moment of peace, a touch of personal expression, and a subtle reminder that even the most hardened witcher deserves a good trim. After all, even the White Wolf needs to look his best when facing down a griffin or charming a sorceress.
