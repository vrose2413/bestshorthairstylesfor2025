**Core Traits:** Bold, energetic, pioneering, independent, confident, impulsive, dynamic.

Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, is all about leading the charge. You’re a natural trailblazer, full of fiery energy and a desire to stand out. Your hair should reflect your dynamic spirit: low-maintenance, impactful, and always ready for action.
