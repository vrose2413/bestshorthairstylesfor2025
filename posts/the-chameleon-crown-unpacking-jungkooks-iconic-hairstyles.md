Jungkook, the "Golden Maknae" of global sensation BTS, is a multifaceted artist whose talent knows no bounds. Beyond his unparalleled vocals, captivating dance, and charming personality, he is also a silent trendsetter, particularly when it comes to his ever-evolving hairstyles. Unlike many celebrities who might stick to a signature look, Jungkook has embraced a remarkable spectrum of cuts, colors, and textures throughout his career, each reflecting his artistic journey, the concept of BTS’s music, and his personal growth.

To ask "What is Jungkook’s hairstyle called?" is to misunderstand the very essence of his hair journey. There isn’t *one* name, but rather a dynamic, living portfolio of looks that have captivated millions and often sparked global trends. His hair is a visual diary, charting his transformation from a fresh-faced teenager to a mature, confident solo artist. This article will delve into the various iconic phases of Jungkook’s hair, exploring the names, styles, and cultural impact of each.

### The Innocent Beginnings: Debut to "The Most Beautiful Moment in Life" Era (2013-2016)

In the early days of BTS, Jungkook embodied the youthful, energetic "boy-next-door" image. His hairstyles during this period were largely simple, practical, and reflective of the typical K-pop idol aesthetic for younger members.

* **The Classic K-Pop Fringe/Bowl Cut Variation:** For much of their debut and early years, Jungkook sported variations of a dark, often black or deep brown, straight-cut fringe that framed his face. The sides were usually kept short, with the top having a bit more volume, sometimes resembling a soft, modern bowl cut. This look was clean, innocent, and emphasized his large, expressive eyes. It was the quintessential "schoolboy" look, fitting perfectly with BTS’s initial rebellious yet youthful concepts like "No More Dream," "Boy In Luv," and "Dope." This style, while common in K-pop, was his foundation, allowing his natural charm to shine through. It rarely had a specific "name" beyond being a standard, neat idol cut.
* **Subtle Textures and Growth:** As BTS transitioned into the "The Most Beautiful Moment in Life" (HYYH) era with songs like "I Need U" and "Run," Jungkook’s hair began to show subtle signs of evolution. While still predominantly dark, the fringe might be slightly longer, allowing for more natural waves or a gentle sweep to the side. The overall length remained relatively short, maintaining a sense of vulnerability and youthful angst that defined this pivotal era for the group. This period saw him experiment with slightly lighter brown tones, adding a touch of warmth to his appearance without straying too far from his natural look.

### The Transition to Maturity: "WINGS" to "Love Yourself" Era (2016-2018)

As BTS’s global star power ascended, so did the sophistication of their concepts and, by extension, Jungkook’s styling. This era marked a significant shift towards more refined, artistic, and sometimes daring looks.

* **The "Comma Hair" (쉼표머리 – Shimpyo Meori):** This became one of Jungkook’s most recognizable and widely emulated styles. Characterized by a fringe that is swept to one side, with a distinct, often dramatic, curve or "comma" shape at the front, revealing part of the forehead. This look added an air of maturity, elegance, and subtle allure. It was often paired with slightly longer sideburns and a more layered cut overall, allowing for greater volume and styling versatility. The "Comma Hair" was prominent during the "Blood Sweat & Tears" and "DNA" eras, perfectly complementing the more sensual and artistic themes of their music. It exuded confidence and a newfound sophistication.
* **Layered and Swept-Back Looks:** Beyond the comma, Jungkook also experimented with longer, more layered cuts that could be swept back from his face, giving him a more mature and princely appearance. These styles often incorporated soft waves or curls, adding texture and dimension. While still predominantly dark brown or black, these cuts showcased his evolving facial features and allowed for a wider range of expressions, from intense to ethereal.
* **First Forays into Color:** While still conservative compared to later years, this period saw Jungkook dabble in richer, warmer brown tones and even subtle reddish hues, particularly around the "Fake Love" era. These colors enhanced the depth of his layered cuts and added to his growing charisma.

### The Revolutionary Long Hair & Mullet Era: "Map of the Soul" (2019-2020)

This period is arguably the most iconic and transformative for Jungkook’s hair, sparking widespread discussion, admiration, and even a global trend among fans. He bravely challenged conventional K-pop idol aesthetics, embracing longer, more fluid styles that redefined masculinity in the industry.

* **The Long, Wavy Flow:** Jungkook began growing out his hair significantly, allowing it to reach shoulder-length or even slightly beyond. This look was often styled with natural waves or loose curls, giving him a romantic, artistic, and somewhat rebellious edge. It was frequently parted down the middle or slightly off-center, allowing his hair to cascade around his face and shoulders. This style was a stark departure from his earlier neat cuts and became a symbol of his artistic freedom and maturation. It allowed for incredible movement during performances, enhancing his stage presence.
* **The Subtle to Pronounced Mullet:** Within the long hair phase, Jungkook famously sported variations of the mullet. Unlike the often-maligned Western mullet of the 80s, Jungkook’s version was refined and stylish. It typically involved shorter hair at the front and sides, gradually lengthening towards the back, often with textured layers. Sometimes it was a subtle "wolf cut" variation, while at other times, the contrast was more pronounced, giving him a distinct rock-star edge. This bold choice was particularly prominent during the "IDOL" and "Dionysus" performances, cementing his status as a fashion pioneer. The mullet, in his hands, became a symbol of defiance and artistic expression, breaking gender norms within the conservative K-pop industry.
* **The Kaleidoscope of Colors:** This era also saw Jungkook’s most adventurous use of hair color. He experimented with striking shades like vibrant blue, deep purple, platinum blonde, and even silver. These bold colors amplified the impact of his longer, textured cuts, turning his hair into a dynamic accessory that perfectly matched the grandeur and artistic depth of BTS’s "Map of the Soul" concepts. Each color seemed to reflect a different facet of his personality and the group’s narrative.

### The Global Pop Star Polish: "Dynamite" to "Permission to Dance" Era (2020-2021)

Following the artistic freedom of the long hair era, BTS’s "Dynamite" and "Butter" ushered in a new chapter of global pop dominance, requiring a more universally appealing, polished, and vibrant image. Jungkook’s hair reflected this shift.

* **The Permed Two-Block:** While the two-block cut (shorter sides and back, longer top) has been a K-pop staple, Jungkook’s version during this period often incorporated a soft perm on the longer top section. This created bouncy, voluminous curls or waves that were both playful and sophisticated. This style was highly versatile, allowing for looks that were neatly parted, swept back, or playfully tousled. It gave him a fresh, approachable, yet undeniably charismatic look that resonated with the bright, optimistic energy of their English-language hits. Colors during this time often reverted to more classic blonde, brown, or black, emphasizing the cut and texture.
* **Textured and Voluminous Looks:** Even without a full perm, his hair was often styled with significant texture and volume, giving it a lively, dynamic feel. This allowed for effortless transitions between more casual, boyish looks and sleek, polished appearances for performances and interviews.

### Solo Debut and Beyond: Reaffirming Versatility (2022-Present)

As Jungkook embarked on his highly anticipated solo career, his hairstyles continued to evolve, often blending elements from his past iconic looks while forging new paths.

* **Return to Darker, Mature Tones:** For his solo debut with "Seven," Jungkook largely returned to his natural dark hair color, often styled in a sleek, slightly longer cut. This choice conveyed a sense of maturity, groundedness, and focus on his artistry. The dark hair allowed his sharp features and intense gaze to take center stage, aligning with the more mature themes of his solo music.
* **Slicked-Back and Textured Styles:** For performances and promotional activities for "Seven," "3D," and "Standing Next to You," Jungkook frequently sported slicked-back or heavily textured styles. These looks emphasized his strong jawline and confident demeanor, projecting a powerful, sophisticated image. The hair might be slightly longer on top, allowing for a variety of textures – from wet-look slickness to voluminous, tousled waves – depending on the concept. This demonstrated his ability to command attention with a more understated yet impactful hairstyle.
* **The Enduring Undercut:** Throughout many of these phases, particularly from the "Love Yourself" era onwards, Jungkook has often maintained an undercut. This involves shaving or closely clipping the hair on the sides and back, leaving the top section much longer. The undercut provides a clean, sharp contrast, adding an edgy element to even his softer looks and allowing for greater versatility in styling the top section. It’s a subtle but consistent element that adds to his modern appeal.

### The Enduring Impact: More Than Just Hair

Jungkook’s hairstyles are more than just aesthetic choices; they are a significant part of his visual narrative and cultural impact.

* **A Visual Diary of Growth:** Each hair phase corresponds to a specific era of BTS’s music and Jungkook’s personal development. From the innocent schoolboy to the daring artist and now the confident solo star, his hair has been a visual testament to his journey.
* **Trendsetter and Influencer:** His long hair and mullet phases, in particular, sparked widespread trends not just among fans but also influenced male fashion and challenged traditional notions of masculinity in K-pop and beyond. He proved that men could embrace longer, more fluid styles without compromising their appeal.
* **Symbol of Artistic Freedom:** His willingness to experiment with bold colors and unconventional cuts reflects the artistic freedom and boundary-pushing spirit that defines BTS. His hair became a canvas for expression, mirroring the innovative concepts of their music.
* **Relatability and Aspiration:** While some of his looks are high-fashion, many, like the "comma hair" or the permed two-block, are highly accessible and have been widely emulated by fans seeking to capture a piece of his charisma.

In conclusion, there is no single, definitive answer to "What is Jungkook’s hairstyle called?" because his hair is a constantly evolving masterpiece. It is a testament to his versatility, his courage to experiment, and his profound understanding of how visual identity intertwines with artistic expression. From the simple fringe of his debut to the revolutionary long locks and the polished sophistication of his solo era, Jungkook’s hair has consistently been a captivating element of his persona, cementing his status not just as a global music icon, but as a true style chameleon whose influence extends far beyond the stage. His hair journey is a reminder that true style is not about adhering to one look, but about embracing change, expressing oneself authentically, and confidently owning every transformation.
